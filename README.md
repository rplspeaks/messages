## About R Paulaseer Lawrie

R Paulaseer Lawrie (Gurudev Shri Lahari Krishna) hails from South TamilNadu of South India, from the land where the river Palar, Cauvery and Thamirabharani flow, and from where as foretold in Srimad Bhagavatham the last avatar would rise on the scene. 

He preached and propogated the truth that there is one GOD in spite of the fact that HE is addressed by different names throughout the world by different religions. His clarion call was to personally experience GOD.

He toured the world many times explaining the people the truth of the Godhead of the Supreme Sacrifice and the need of humility. His teachings are universally accepted and revered by innumerable followers around the world. 

In this Blog cum Vlog (video blog), you find Him inviting you to surrender yourself to become the subject of GOD.
